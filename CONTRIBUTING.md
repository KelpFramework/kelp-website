# Contributing to Kelp-Website

> Guidelines for project contributors 


## Fixing bugs
If you find a bug in our code and know how to fix it, you are of course welcome to do so!
Just be sure to write code that is efficient, especially if you are working with a part of the webserver or the database.


## Adding new features
You can also add new features that were requested or that you personally miss while using the website.
(You can find a table with some planed features [here](https://github.com/KelpFramework/kelp-website#contributing))
However, please don't just start writing code for features that are already wip. (Except you have permission from the person who is in charge of this feature, of course).


## Adding documentation
Lastly, if you want, you can also add documentation to all parts of the code and or project.


## Conventions 

- To make development easier for other developers, every contributor should follow the same conventions.
- Please don't add any new Python modules if not absolutely necessary.
- Keep a logical and ordered file structure.



## Important notice valid for every contribution
There will be no guarantee that any of your work will make it into the public release!
